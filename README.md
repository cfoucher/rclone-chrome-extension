# Rclone Chrome Extension

Currently only works on gdrive.

No data is transferred outside of your browser. Add password and salt from options page. This extension automatically adds an "Rclone Decrypt" button on the top left of the page near the "New" button that will decrypt all files and folders on the page that it can.

Warning: This can be brittle depending on future site changes and may stop working at any time.
